SOP – co-registration EEG and EyeTracking

For installation and technical details see: https://github.com/nicobast/project_coregistration_EEG_ET

1.	Make sure that the room is darkened
  a.	Screen is turned on (desktop image)
  b.	Both ceiling lights are on
  c.	Measure luminance with luxmeter (should be around 180 lux)
  d.	Luxmeter sensor should be on par with head position and facing the screen
2.	Start calibration:
  a.	Start EyeTracker (button on the back)
  b.	Start TobiiProEyeTrackerManager on Desktop
  c.	Selection EyeTracker (Tobii Pro Spektrum) and select START CALIBRATION
  (right panel)
  d.	Position screen starts up: position participant till eye are tracked successfully
  e.	START CALIBRATION
  f.	 Calibration was successful, if 3 of the 5 points are hit
    i.	Center point should always be hit
    ii.	Hit means that the majority mean measurement (white dot) is within the displayed point (blue dot)
3.	Start Presentation
  a.	Check whether LSL Server is Status: Open and Name: eventmarker
4.	Start EEG_ET (batch script file)
  a.	Enter participant ID with suffix for specific Presentation task (e.g. xxx_posner)
  b.	Press enter and start scripts:
    i.	Three scripts will be started
    ii.	LSL eye-tracker server (tobiilsl; pushed ET data into LSL)
    iii.	LSL eye tracker client (pulls ET data and saves to file)
      	  --> also displays left and right pupil size measurement every 250ms
    iv.	 LSL Presentation client (pulls Presentation eventmarker and timestamp and saves to file)
    v.	(LSL Presentation server is provided by Presentation, see 3.)
  c.	 data is continuously recorded
5.	Start task in Presentation
